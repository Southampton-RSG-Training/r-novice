# Data Manipulation using **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do
more stuff. The functions we’ve been using so far, like `str()` or
`data.frame()`, come built into R; packages give you access to more of
them. Before you use a package for the first time you need to install it
on your machine, and then you should import it in every subsequent R
session when you need it. You should already have installed the
**`tidyverse`** package. This is an “umbrella-package” that installs
several packages useful for data analysis which work together well such
as **`tidyr`**, **`dplyr`**, **`ggplot2`**, **`tibble`**, etc.

The **`tidyverse`** package tries to address 3 common issues that arise
when doing data analysis with some of the functions that come with R:

1.  The results from a base R function sometimes depend on the type of
    data.
2.  Using R expressions in a non standard way, which can be confusing
    for new learners.
3.  Hidden arguments, having default operations that new learners are
    not aware of.

If we haven’t already done so, we can type
`install.packages("tidyverse")` straight into the console. In fact, it’s
better to write this in the console than in our script for any package,
as there’s no need to re-install packages every time we run the script.

Then, to load the package type:

``` r
## load the tidyverse packages, incl. dplyr
library(tidyverse)
```
### Getting started with Tidyverse

We’ll read in our data using the `read_csv()` function, from the
tidyverse package **`readr`**, instead of `read.csv()`.

``` r
surveys <- read_csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

You will see the message `Parsed with column specification`, followed by
each column name and its data type. When you execute `read_csv` on a
data file, it looks through the first 1000 rows of each column and
guesses the data type for each column as it reads it into R. For
example, in this dataset, `read_csv` reads `weight` as `col_double` (a
numeric data type), and `species` as `col_character`. You have the
option to specify the data type for a column manually by using the
`col_types` argument in `read_csv`.

``` r
## inspect the data
str(surveys)
```

``` r
## preview the data
View(surveys)
```

Notice that the class of the data is now `tbl_df`

This is referred to as a “tibble”. Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors
of the data frame objects we introduced in the previous lesson. The data
structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes the only
difference is that, in addition to displaying the data type of each column under its
name, it only prints the first few rows of data and only as many
columns as fit on one screen.

## What are **`dplyr`** and **`tidyr`**?

The package **`dplyr`** provides easy tools for the most common data
manipulation tasks, built to work directly with data frames.

The package **`tidyr`** addresses the common problem of wanting to
reshape your data for plotting and use by different R functions.
Sometimes we want data sets where we have one row per measurement.
Sometimes we want a data frame where each measurement type has its own
column, and rows are instead more aggregated groups (e.g., a time
period, an experimental unit like a plot or a batch number). Moving back
and forth between these formats is non-trivial, and **`tidyr`** gives
you tools for this and more sophisticated data manipulation.

## Managing Data with dplyr

We’re going to learn some of the most common **`dplyr`** functions:

  - `select()`: subset columns
  - `filter()`: subset rows on conditions
  - `mutate()`: create new columns by using information from other
    columns
  - `group_by()` and `summarize()`: create summary statistics on grouped
    data
  - `arrange()`: sort results
  - `count()`: count discrete values

> ## Challenge

> share them within your group. 
{: .challenge}


## Selecting columns and filtering rows

To select columns of a data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to
this function is the data frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent
arguments are the columns to keep.

``` r
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To select all columns *except* certain ones, put a “-” in front of the
variable to exclude it.

``` r
select(surveys, -record_id, -species_id)
```

This will select all the variables in `surveys` except `record_id` and
`species_id`.

To choose rows based on a specific criterion, use `filter()`:

``` r
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

## Pipes

What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.

With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use that
as input to the next function, like this:

``` r
surveys2 <- filter(surveys, weight < 5)
surveys_sml <- select(surveys2, species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of objects
that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be
hard to keep track of.

You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another), like
this:

``` r
surveys_sml <- select(filter(surveys, weight < 5), species_id, sex, weight)
```

This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are
nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case,
filtering, then selecting).

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is
useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset. Pipes in R
look like `%>%` and are made available via the **`magrittr`** package,
installed automatically with **`dplyr`**.

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above code, we use the pipe to send the `surveys` dataset first
through `filter()` to keep rows where `weight` is less than 5, then
through `select()` to keep only the `species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`
columns. Since `%>%` takes the object on its left and passes it as the
first argument to the function on its right, we don’t need to explicitly
include the data frame as an argument to the `filter()` and `select()`
functions any more.

Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word “then”. For
instance, in the above example, we took the data frame `surveys`, *then*
we `filter`-ed for rows with `weight < 5`, *then* we `select`ed columns
`species_id`, `sex`, and `weight`. The **`dplyr`** functions by
themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear
workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of
data frames.

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data,
we can assign it a new name:

``` r
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

### Mutate

Frequently you’ll want to create new columns based on the values in
existing columns, for example to do unit conversions, or to find the
ratio of values in two columns. For this we’ll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

``` r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

You can also create a second new column based on the first new column
within the same call of `mutate()`:

``` r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000,
         weight_lb = weight_kg * 2.2)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few
rows, you can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data. (Pipes work
with non-**`dplyr`** functions, too, as long as the **`dplyr`** or
`magrittr` package is loaded).

``` r
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

The first few rows of the output are full of `NA`s, so if we wanted to
remove those we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head()
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is an `NA`.
The `!` symbol negates the result, so we’re asking for every row where
weight *is not* an `NA`.

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the `summarize()` function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the
*split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some
analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes
this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()`, which collapses
each group into a single-row summary of that group. `group_by()` takes
as arguments the column names that contain the **categorical** variables
for which you want to calculate the summary statistics. So to compute
the mean `weight` by sex:

``` r
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn’t run
off the screen anymore. It’s one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over data
frame.

You can also group by multiple columns:

``` r
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  tail()
```

Here, we used `tail()` to look at the last six rows of our summary.
Before, we had used `head()` to look at the first six rows. We can see
that the `sex` column contains `NA` values because some animals had
escaped before their sex and body weights could be determined. The
resulting `mean_weight` column does not contain `NA` but `NaN` (which
refers to “Not a Number”) because `mean()` was called on a vector of
`NA` values while at the same time setting `na.rm = TRUE`. To avoid
this, we can remove the missing values for weight before we attempt to
calculate the summary statistics on weight. Because the missing values
are removed first, we can omit `na.rm = TRUE` when computing the mean:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

Here, again, the output from these calls doesn’t run off the screen
anymore. If you want to display more data, you can use the `print()`
function at the end of your chain with the argument `n` specifying the
number of rows to display:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n = 15)
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at
the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance,
we could add a column indicating the minimum weight for each species for
each sex:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the
values. For instance, we can sort on `min_weight` to put the lighter
species first:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(min_weight)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we
want to sort the results by decreasing order of mean weight:

``` r
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_weight))
```

#### Counting

When working with data, we often want to know the number of observations
found for each factor or combination of factors. For this task,
**`dplyr`** provides `count()`. For example, if we wanted to count the
number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

``` r
surveys %>%
    count(sex)
```

The `count()` function is shorthand for something we’ve already seen:
grouping by a variable, and summarizing it by counting the number of
observations in that group. In other words, `surveys %>% count()` is
equivalent to:

``` r
surveys %>%
    group_by(sex) %>%
    summarize(count = n())
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument:

``` r
surveys %>%
    count(sex, sort = TRUE)
```

Previous example shows the use of `count()` to count the number of
rows/observations for *one* factor (i.e., `sex`). If we wanted to count
*combination of factors*, such as `sex` and `species`, we would specify
the first and the second factor as the arguments of `count()`:

``` r
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species)
```

With the above code, we can proceed with `arrange()` to sort the table
according to a number of criteria so that we have a better comparison.
For instance, we might want to arrange the table above in (i) an
alphabetical order of the levels of the species and (ii) in descending
order of the count:

``` r
surveys %>%
  count(sex, species) %>%
  arrange(species, desc(n))
```

From the table above, we may learn that, for instance, there are 75
observations of the *albigula* species that are not specified for its
sex (i.e. `NA`).

## Formatting Dates

One of the most common issues that new (and experienced\!) R users have
is converting date and time information into a variable that is
appropriate and usable during analyses. As a reminder from earlier in
this lesson, the best practice for dealing with date data is to ensure
that each component of your date is stored as a separate variable. Using
`str()`, We can confirm that our data frame has a separate column for
day, month, and year, and that each contains integer values.

``` r
str(surveys)
```

We are going to use the `ymd()` function from the package
**`lubridate`** (which belongs to the **`tidyverse`**; learn more
[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/)). When you load the **`tidyverse`**
(`library("tidyverse")`), the core packages get loaded. **`lubridate`**
however does not belong to the core tidyverse, so you have to load it
explicitly with `library(lubridate)`

Start by loading the required package:

``` r
library("lubridate")
```

`ymd()` takes a vector representing year, month, and day, and converts
it to a `Date` vector. `Date` is a class of data recognized by R as
being a date and can be manipulated as such. The argument that the
function requires is a character vector formatted as “YYYY-MM-DD”.

Let’s create a date object and inspect the structure:

``` r
my_date <- ymd("2015-01-01")
str(my_date)
```

Now let’s paste the year, month, and day separately - we get the same
result:

``` r
# sep indicates the character to use to separate each component
my_date <- ymd(paste("2015", "1", "1", sep = "-"))
str(my_date)
```

We can apply this operation to each row of the surveys dataset. We
extract the vectors `surveys$year`, `surveys$month`, and `surveys$day`.
Using `paste()` we can combine these vectors into a new vector for
character dates.

``` r
dates_char_vec <- paste(surveys$year, surveys$month, surveys$day, sep = "-")
```

This character vector can be used as the argument for `ymd()`:

``` r
date_vec <- ymd(dates_char_vec)
```

Something went wrong lets use `summary` to inspect `date_vec`:

``` r
summary(date_vec)
```
~~~
     Min.      1st Qu.       Median         Mean      3rd Qu.         Max. 
"1977-07-16" "1984-03-12" "1990-07-22" "1990-12-15" "1997-07-29" "2002-12-31" 
         NA's 
        "129"
~~~
{: .output}

Some dates have missing values. Let’s investigate where they are coming
from.

``` r
missing_dates_vec <- dates_char_vec[is.na(date_vec)]
head(missing_dates_vec)
```
~~~
[1] "2000-9-31" "2000-4-31" "2000-4-31" "2000-4-31" "2000-4-31" "2000-9-31"
~~~
{: .output}

or

``` r
missing_dates_tab <- surveys[is.na(date_vec), c("year", "month", "day")]
head(missing_dates_tab)
```
~~~
      year month day
 3144 2000     9  31
 3817 2000     4  31
 3818 2000     4  31
 3819 2000     4  31
 3820 2000     4  31
 3856 2000     9  31
 ~~~
{: .output}

Why did these dates fail to parse? If you had to use these data for your
analyses, how would you deal with this situation?

The resulting `Date` vector `date_vec` can be added to `surveys` as a
new column called `date`:

``` r
surveys$date <- date_vec
str(surveys) # notice the new column, with 'date' as the class

## Reshaping with pivot_wider and pivot_longer

In the [spreadsheet
lesson](https://southampton-rsg.github.io/spreadsheets-data-organisation-and-management/01-format-data/index.html),
we discussed how to structure our data leading to the four rules
defining a tidy dataset:

1.  Each variable has its own column
2.  Each observation has its own row
3.  Each value must have its own cell
4.  Each type of observational unit forms a table

Here we examine the fourth rule: Each type of observational unit forms a
table.

In `surveys`, the rows of `surveys` contain the values of variables
associated with each record (the unit), values such as the weight or sex
of each animal associated with each record. What if instead of comparing
records, we wanted to compare the different mean weight of each genus
between plots? (Ignoring `plot_type` for simplicity).

We’d need to create a new table where each row (the unit) is comprised
of values of variables associated with each plot. In practical terms
this means the values in `genus` would become the names of column
variables and the cells would contain the values of the mean weight
observed on each plot.

Having created a new table, it is therefore straightforward to explore
the relationship between the weight of different genera within, and
between, the plots. The key point here is that we are still following a
tidy data structure, but we have **reshaped** the data according to the
observations of interest: average genus weight per plot instead of
recordings per date.

The opposite transformation would be to transform column names into
values of a variable.

We can do both these of transformations with two `tidyr` functions,
`pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.

#### Pivot_wider

`pivot_wider()` takes three principal arguments:

1.  the data
2.  *names_from* indicates which column (or columns) to get the name of
    the output column from
3.  *values_from* indicates which column (or columns) to get the cell
    values from

Further arguments include *values_fill* which, if set, fills in missing
values with the value provided.

Let’s use `pivot_wider()` to transform surveys to find the mean weight
of each genus in each plot over the entire survey period. We use
`filter()`, `group_by()` and `summarize()` to filter our observations
and variables of interest, and create a new variable for the
`mean_weight`.

``` r
surveys_gw <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(plot_id, genus) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))

str(surveys_gw)
```

This yields `surveys_gw` where the observations for each plot are spread
across multiple rows, 196 observations of 3 variables. Using
`pivot_wider()` with *names\_from* `genus` and *values\_from*
`mean_weight` this becomes 24 observations of 11 variables, one row for
each plot.

``` r
surveys_wide<- surveys_gw %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = genus, values_from = mean_weight)

str(surveys_wide)
```

![](fig/pivot_wider.png)

We could now plot comparisons between the weight of genera in different
plots, although we may wish to fill in the missing values first.

``` r
surveys_gw %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = genus, values_from = mean_weight, values_fill = 0) %>%
  head()
```

#### Pivot_longer

The opposing situation could occur if we had been provided with data in
the form of `surveys_wide`, where the genus names are column names, but
we wish to treat them as values of a genus variable instead.

In this situation we are gathering the column names and turning them
into a pair of new variables. One variable represents the column names
as values, and the other variable contains the values previously
associated with the column names.

`pivot_longer()` takes four principal arguments:

1.  the data
2.  *cols* indicates the columns to pivot into longer format (or those
    not to pivot)
3.  *names_to* indicates the name of the column to create from the data
    stored in the column names of data.
4.  *values_to* indicates the name of the column to create from the
    data stored in cell values.

To recreate `surveys_gw` from `surveys_wide` we would set *names_to*
`genus` and *values_to* `mean_weight` and use all columns except
`plot_id` for the key variable. Here we exclude `plot_id` from being
pivoted.

``` r
surveys_long <- surveys_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -plot_id, names_to = "genus", values_to = "mean_weight")

str(surveys_long)
```

![](fig/pivot_longer.png)

Note that now the `NA` genera are included in the new pivot_longer
format. Using pivot_wider and then pivot_longer can be a useful way to
balance out a dataset so every replicate has the same composition.

We could also have used a specification for what columns to include.
This can be useful if you have a large number of identifying columns,
and it’s easier to specify what to pivot than what to leave alone. And
if the columns are directly adjacent, we don’t even need to list them
all out - just use the `:` operator!

``` r
surveys_wide %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = Baiomys:Spermophilus, names_to = "genus", values_to = "mean_weight") %>%
  head()
```

# Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use **`dplyr`** to extract information
from or summarize your raw data, you may want to export these new data
sets to share them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similar to the `read_csv()` function used for reading CSV files into R,
there is a `write_csv()` function that generates CSV files from data
frames.

Before using `write_csv()`, we are going to create a new folder, `data`,
in our working directory that will store this generated dataset. We
don’t want to write generated datasets in the same directory as our
raw data. It’s good practice to keep them separate. The `data_raw`
folder should only contain the raw, unaltered data, and should be left
alone to make sure we don’t delete or modify it. In contrast, our script
will generate the contents of the `data` directory, so even if the files
it contains are deleted, we can always re-generate them.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to prepare
a cleaned up version of the data set that doesn’t include any missing
data.

Let’s start by removing observations of animals for which `weight` and
`hindfoot_length` are missing, or the `sex` has not been determined:

``` r
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight),           # remove missing weight
         !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
         !is.na(sex))                # remove missing sex
```

Because we are interested in plotting how species abundances have
changed through time, we are also going to remove observations for rare
species (i.e., that have been observed less than 50 times). We will do
this in two steps: first we are going to create a data set that counts
how often each species has been observed, and filter out the rare
species; then, we will extract only the observations for these more
common species:

``` r
## Extract the most common species_id
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
    count(species_id) %>%
    filter(n >= 50)

## Only keep the most common species
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
  filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

To make sure that everyone has the same data set, check that
`surveys_complete` has 30463 rows and 13 columns by typing
`dim(surveys_complete)`.

Now that our data set is ready, we can save it as a CSV file in our
`data` folder.

``` r
write_csv(surveys_complete, file = "data/surveys_complete.csv")
```
